Collection of High School Math Course Notes by Eldiiar Bekbolotov

First released on Replit late fall 2023 originally for a Business class assignment.

Edited and re-released April 2025 using Netlify, mainly because Replit has removed the free tier of it's web hosting.

However, I have decided not to commit to updating the lesson content on this website, so the grade 9 course will not be completed and grade 10, 11, 12 courses empty.
