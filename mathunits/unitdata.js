        content: `<P>Here's a summary of numbers:
<br><br>
Whole Numbers are numbers without decimal parts. Cannot be fractional or negative numbers.<br>
e.g. 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
<br><br>
Integers are all whole numbers, including negative whole numbers.<br>
e.g. -5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5
<br><br>
Rational Numbers are numbers which can be written as a fraction or any ratio. Dividing one integer by another integer will give you a rational number. These can go on forever, as long as they repeat.
<br>e.g. 1/2, 1/3, 0.5, 0.3333333..., 0.15151515..., 9.32, 932/100
<br><br>
Irrational Numbers go on forever but are non-repeating. If you can't write a number as a simple fraction, it is an irrational number.<br>
e.g. Pi (3.1415926...), √2 (1.4142135), √5 (2.23606797749...)
<br><br>
Real Numbers are all of the numbers you can find on a number line. Whole numbers, integers, rational and irrational numbers are all a subset of real numbers.<br>
e.g. 123, -7, Pi, 0.987231, -412, 9, 12, 3, 0, 1</p>`,

                    To add fractions with the same denominators, simply add the numerators and keep the denominator the same.
                    <br>
                    Example: 3/9 + 1/9 = 4/9
                    <br>If the denominators are not the same, make them the same by finding the Lowest Common Denominator. You can only add fractions if they have the same denominators.
                    <br>
                    Example: <br>1/4+1/3
                    <br>The Lowest Common Denominator of 4 and 3 is 12. Therefore, we have to change the fractions so that the denominator is 12.
                    <br>
                    3/12 + 4/12 = 7/12
                    <br>
                    So 1/4+1/3 = 7/12
                    <br>
                    
                    <b>Subtracting Fractions</b>: To subtract fractions with the same denominators, simply subtract the numerators and keep the denominator the same.<br>Example: 5/9 - 1/9 = 4/9<br>If the denominators are not the same, make them the same by finding the Lowest Common Denominator. Then, subtract the numerators. You can only subtract fractions with the same denominators.<br>Example: 10/20 - 2/40 = 10/20 - 1/20 = 9/20`,
